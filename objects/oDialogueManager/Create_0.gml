	"[ts:slow]Well, not entirely finished. There are still bugs and the UI could be nicer. But you're working!",
	"[ts:slow]So, you're a [c:orange]program[c:white]. Your objective is to defragment and encode [c:orange]memories[c:white].",
	"[ts:slow]You have the capacity to learn and adapt as you succeed or fail.",
	"[ts:slow]So users can understand how you work, it will appear to them like a [c:orange]game[c:white] of sorts. An old, recognizable one.",
	"[ts:slow]The game works like this: [c:orange]spell words[c:white] on the board using the tiles in your hand. Simple.",
	"[ts:slow]Letters have point values that are added to your [c:orange]score[c:white] whenever you make a play with them.",
	"[ts:slow]The first word must cover the star tile and every word must be longer than 1 letter.",
	"[ts:slow]Reach the target score to complete the level and process the memory.",

	"[ts:slow]You may've noticed that you can accrue [c:orange]currency[c:white] by completing levels or collecting [c:orange]coins[c:white] through plays.",
	"[ts:slow]You can spend this currency, called [c:orange]Mytes[c:white], at the shop by clicking on its icon on the [c:orange]map[c:white] between levels.",
	"[ts:slow]Also, you can [c:orange]type[c:white] any letter to [c:orange]place[c:white] a tile matching that letter from your hand to your cursor.",

	[["[chr:Cress][ts:slow]Alright, last level. Well, of this [c:orange]floor[c:white].",
	"[ts:slow]In this simulation, there are 3 floors and each floor has 3 levels.",
	"[ts:slow]Once you complete the final level of any floor, you'll get to pick a [c:orange]charm[c:white] instead of a tile as a reward.",
	"[ts:slow]After this level, you'll proceed to the next floor, where the [c:orange]difficulty[c:white] will increase.",
	"[ts:slow]I'm leaving you on your own now. Good luck!",
